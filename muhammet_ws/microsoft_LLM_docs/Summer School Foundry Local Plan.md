The goal is to **guide beginner computer science students through a
*full-time, one-month summer program in which they build a local
Q&A/knowledge assistant using Microsoft Foundry Local for offline model
inference and the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern. The
final project is inspired by the Microsoft Tech Community example of a
local RAG support agent that answers questions from documents with zero
Internet dependency. By the program's end, each student team will have a
working offline Q&A chatbot that can answer questions about a small
document collection (e.g. course notes, manuals, FAQs) by retrieving
information locally and integrating it into a large language model's
responses.

**Program Structure:** We divide the month into three phases, each
focusing on specific skills and deliverables:

-   **Phase 1 -- Foundational Learning (Weeks 1--2):** Introduction to
    RAG concepts, Foundry Local, embeddings, vector search, SQLite, and
    prompt engineering fundamentals.

-   **Phase 2 -- Project Implementation (Weeks 3--4):** Hands-on
    development of the RAG application, from data ingestion and
    retrieval pipeline to app integration with the on-device LLM (Large
    Language Model).

-   **Phase 3 -- Testing & Documentation (Week 5, and optionally Week
    6):** System testing and evaluation, performance tuning, and
    preparing project documentation and final presentations.

Below, each phase is broken down by week with learning objectives,
resources, **hands-on exercises**, and **milestones**. The schedule is
adaptable (some topics may overlap between weeks as needed for
scaffolding). **Official Microsoft resources and high-quality
tutorials** are provided for each topic. (Community blog sources are
noted as such.)

## **Project Overview & Key Technologies**

Before diving into the weekly plan, let's clarify **the project and its
components**:

-   **Project Aim:** Build a **local document Q&A assistant** -- a
    simple chatbot that runs entirely on a student's computer. It uses
    **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer user questions by
    *retrieving relevant content from a local knowledge base of
    documents and feeding it to a local LLM* for answer generation. This
    results in **fewer hallucinations and more accurate, source-grounded
    answers**. The assistant can run offline (no internet needed) via
    **Microsoft Foundry Local**, which provides an *on-device LLM
    runtime*.
    [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

-   **Foundry Local:** *What is it?* Foundry Local is an **end-to-end
    local AI solution** that provides a lightweight runtime and SDK for
    running large language models completely *on a user's device*, with
    a curated catalog of optimized models. **No cloud account or GPU is
    required** -- Foundry Local automatically downloads & manages models
    and runs inference with CPU/NPU acceleration, so apps can deliver
    **local, offline AI with zero network calls**. This is key to our
    project, as it lets students experiment with an **LLM (e.g. a
    smaller GPT variant) locally**.
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/what-is-foundry-local)
    [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

-   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** RAG is an **AI design
    pattern** where you **Retrieve** relevant information from a
    document set, **Augment** the model's input prompt with that info as
    context, then have the model **Generate** an answer. The model's
    responses are thus *grounded in your own data* (reducing
    hallucination and enabling source citations) by combining
    **embedding-based semantic search** with an LLM. We'll explore *why*
    RAG is useful (especially for custom Q&A agents) and compare it with
    simpler context injection methods.
    [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

-   **Embeddings & Vector Search:** We'll introduce **text embeddings**
    (numerical vector representations of text meaning) and how to use
    them for **semantic similarity search**. Students will learn how RAG
    typically relies on an *embedding model* to convert documents into
    vectors for storing in a *vector database*, and how queries can be
    embedded and matched with relevant documents by measuring vector
    similarity. We will see this both conceptually and in practice with
    Foundry Local's embedding capabilities.
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

-   **SQLite for Local Data:** We use **SQLite** as a lightweight local
    database to store document texts and their embeddings. SQLite is a
    *serverless, self-contained SQL database* (just a single file) and
    is the world's most widely deployed database engine. Its advantages
    include *no separate server, cross-platform support, and simple
    integration*, making it ideal for local data storage. We'll cover
    basic SQL/SQLite usage so students can confidently use it to manage
    their documents and vectors (e.g. storing and retrieving *embedding
    vectors* and text chunks).
    [\[sqlite.org\]](https://sqlite.org/index.html)
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/data-access/sqlite-data-access)

-   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting good LLM prompts (especially
    **system prompts** for role instructions and **user prompts** for
    queries) is vital for effective answers. We'll discuss basic
    **prompt engineering techniques** for Q&A tasks, such as instructing
    the model to cite sources and not answer if unsure. Students will
    practice writing simple prompts and understand how prompt design can
    influence the model's behavior.

-   **Project Architecture:** The final application will have a
    straightforward architecture with all components on one machine. It
    consists of a **client interface** (e.g. a basic web UI or console
    input for questions), a **server/pipeline** layer that handles user
    queries and orchestrates retrieval & generation, a **data layer**
    (SQLite database storing document embeddings), and an **AI layer**
    (the Foundry Local LLM performing on-device inference). Below is a
    visual overview of this architecture:
    [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

![./media/image2.png](./media/image2.png) *Figure 1: Architecture of a local RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Foundry Local on a single
device. The user's query is processed by a local application which
retrieves relevant document chunks from a SQLite vector database
("vector search"), then sends the query plus retrieved context
("augmented context") to a local LLM via the Foundry Local SDK. The
LLM's answer is returned to the user -- all with no internet connection
needed.*

Above are the **core topics and references** that will guide instruction
and self-study. With the context set, we can now detail the
**phase-by-phase plan**:

## **Phase 1 (Weeks 1--2): Foundational Learning**

**Objectives:** Build a strong conceptual foundation in RAG and local AI
tools. By end of Week 2, students should **understand how RAG works**
and be comfortable with the basic technologies and development
environment. They'll have **Foundry Local installed and tested on their
laptops (both Windows & macOS)**, a sample **SQLite database** created,
and perhaps small test programs run (embedding generation and vector
similarity search).

### **Week 1:** *RAG Concept & Local AI Setup*

**Topics & Activities:**

-   **Intro to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Start by
    explaining the *problem* that RAG solves. Use simple examples: ask a
    general LLM about a specific domain question (likely gets it wrong),
    then explain how RAG can incorporate external knowledge to improve
    answers. Cover RAG's **"retrieve, augment, generate"** steps and the
    resulting benefits (more accurate answers, reduced hallucinations).
    [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

    -   *Resource:* *Microsoft Tech Community* blog post *"Building Your
        First Local RAG Application with Foundry Local"* -- **read the
        introduction and "What is RAG" section** for an accessible
        overview (community content).
        [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

    -   *Exercise:* **Q&A role-play:** Provide a short document or
        knowledge base (1 page) and have students simulate RAG manually
        -- one acts as the "retriever" (finding the relevant paragraph),
        another as the "LLM" (formulating an answer using that info).
        This illustrates how adding context helps answer questions.

-   **Understanding Foundry Local & Environment Setup:** Introduce
    **Microsoft Foundry Local** and why it's key to our project.
    Emphasize that it allows running an **LLM entirely offline on
    student laptops** (no cloud needed), and mention supported platforms
    (Windows/macOS/Linux). Cover Foundry Local's main features:
    on-device model downloads, hardware acceleration (utilizing
    CPU/GPU/NPU automatically), and an easy-to-use SDK for Python (and
    other languages).

    -   *Resource:* **Official documentation -- "What is Foundry
        Local?"** for a high-level overview. Also see **Microsoft
        Learn's "Get started with Foundry Local" guide** (select
        *Python* tab) for step-by-step installation instructions.

        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

    -   *Exercise:* **Install Foundry Local SDK** (latest version) on
        each student's machine (ensuring both Windows and macOS
        installations are tested). Follow the official instructions to
        install via pip (pip install foundry-local-sdk or OS-specific
        variant). To verify the setup, run a *"Hello Model" test:* e.g.,
        writing a short Python script to use Foundry Local's SDK to load
        a small model (like phi-1.5-mini) and generate a simple
        completion (e.g., given prompt "Hello, world" have it complete
        the greeting). This confirms the runtime is working and
        introduces the API.
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

-   **Basic Python App Structure:** (If needed due to student
    background) Review how to structure a Python project: using a
    main.py with a clear entry point (if \_\_name\_\_ ==
    \"\_\_main\_\_\": main()), dividing code into functions or modules
    (for clarity as the project grows), and managing dependencies via
    requirements.txt. Use a simple example (like a "Hello LLM" project)
    to illustrate how to organize code.

    -   *Resource:* **Microsoft Learn --** *"Tutorial: Build a RAG
        application".* Start reading the section *"Prerequisites"* and
        the part about setting up main.py. The sample code will serve as
        a template for our project structure.
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

    -   *Exercise:* **Create a skeleton project:** Initialize a new
        Python project folder for the RAG assistant. Create a main.py
        file and test it by printing a greeting. If using a code editor
        like VS Code, ensure all students can run the program in their
        environment.

**Milestones by end of Week 1:** All students have **Foundry Local
installed and working** on their machines, have a basic project folder
with a main.py file, and can run a trivial Foundry Local inference
(e.g., output from a local model to confirm proper installation).

### **Week 2:** *Core Techniques -- Embeddings, Vector Search & SQLite*

**Topics & Activities:**

-   **Embeddings & Vector Similarity:** Introduce the concept of **text
    embeddings** -- numeric vector representations of text that capture
    semantic meaning. Explain how similar text → similar vectors,
    enabling *semantic search*. This is essential for RAG's retrieval
    step. Discuss how one can get embeddings (via specialized models
    like *OpenAI's ada* or local ones) and measure similarity (e.g., via
    **cosine similarity**).
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

    -   *Resource:* **Microsoft Learn -- "Tutorial: Build a RAG
        application"**, sections *"Generate document embeddings"* and
        *"Search for relevant documents"* (official). This shows how to
        use Foundry Local's Python SDK to generate embeddings for a list
        of documents and perform a similarity search by computing cosine
        similarity of vectors.
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app),
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

    -   *Exercise:* **Embedding demo:** Provide a small list of example
        sentences and have students use Foundry Local's SDK to generate
        embeddings for each sentence (using a small embedding model like
        qwen3-embedding-0.6b). Then, for a given query (also embedded),
        have them code a simple loop to compute similarity scores and
        find the top match. This can be based on the official tutorial's
        code (which already includes a find_relevant() function) and
        will solidify how vector search works.
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app),
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

-   **Storing & Querying Embeddings with SQLite:** Explain why we might
    need a **vector store** or database when scaling beyond a few
    in-memory documents. Introduce **SQLite** as a *fast, serverless
    local database engine* perfect for our use-case (no separate server
    or setup; a single file holds all data). Ensure students understand
    basic **SQL** operations (creating tables, inserting and querying
    data) at least conceptually.
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/data-access/sqlite-data-access)

    -   *Resource:* *"Benefits of SQLite for local storage"* (section in
        *Microsoft Windows App Development* documentation) for key
        points on SQLite's advantages. Optionally, use a
        beginner-friendly **SQLite tutorial** (e.g., **W3Schools SQL
        tutorial**, "SQLite SELECT" pages -- third-party, clearly marked
        as such).
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/data-access/sqlite-data-access)

    -   *Exercise:* **SQL sandbox:** Have students install the sqlite3
        command-line tool or use a simple Python script with the
        built-in sqlite3 module to create a small database (e.g., a
        documents table with id, content, embedding fields). Let them
        practice **inserting** a few sample rows and running a **query**
        to retrieve a record by an id or filter by a text keyword. This
        gives them familiarity with the process of persisting and
        retrieving data -- skills needed when they integrate SQLite into
        the RAG pipeline.

-   **Basic Prompt Engineering for Q&A:** Discuss how simply retrieving
    documents isn't enough -- *how we present the info to the model
    matters*. Introduce the concept of **system vs user prompts** (roles
    in the Chat Completion API) and how to instruct the model to use the
    retrieved text and not guess beyond it. Share simple guidelines like
    *"If you don't find info in context, say you don't know"* or
    *"always include source names in the answer"*.

    -   *Resource:* **Microsoft Learn -- "Prompt engineering
        techniques"**, especially the *Basics* of prompt construction
        and use of *system messages* (official).
        [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering)

    -   *Exercise:* **Prompt experiments:** Using a public web AI (like
        Bing Chat or ChatGPT, which they've likely encountered), have
        students try providing the *same question with and without
        additional context* (e.g., "Answer using only this info:
        \[provide a passage\]"). Observe how context changes the answer.
        This is a conceptual parallel to what their RAG chatbot will do.

**Milestones by end of Week 2:** Students have a working knowledge of
**RAG, Foundry Local, embeddings, and SQLite.** They have created a test
SQLite database (or at least conceptually designed the schema for
storing documents and vectors). They have also practiced retrieving
similar text via computing cosine similarity on embeddings in Python,
and they understand how to phrase basic prompts for the model. **All
prerequisites for hands-on building are in place.**

[\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

## **Phase 2 (Weeks 3--4): Project Implementation**

**Objectives:** Over \~2 weeks, students will **develop a functional
local RAG application**. They will apply what they learned to implement
each component: document ingestion, vectorization, retrieval, and LLM
integration. By the end of Phase 2, each student (or team) will have a
**working offline Q&A chatbot** that can answer questions by retrieving
info from its local document store before invoking the model.

### **Week 3:** *Data Ingestion & Retrieval Pipeline*

**Topics & Activities:**

-   **Designing the Knowledge Base & Data Prep:** Decide on the small
    set of documents for the Q&A assistant (e.g. 5--10 short documents
    such as technical articles, product FAQs, or course notes --
    provided by the instructor or chosen by students). Discuss
    strategies for splitting documents into chunks (as RAG typically
    works at passage-level chunks, e.g., \~1--3 paragraphs each).
    Students will implement a **data ingestion script** to:
    [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

1.  **Chunk** their documents into smaller passages.

2.  Compute an **embedding** for each chunk using Foundry Local's
    embedding model.

3.  **Store** each chunk and its embedding vector in SQLite for later
    retrieval.

-   *Resource:* **Microsoft Learn -- "Build a RAG application"**
    (official). Follow the sections on *creating a knowledge base* and
    *generating embeddings*. The tutorial's sample code (Python) can be
    adapted: it shows reading documents, generating embeddings in batch,
    and saving them in a Python list (we'll extend this to saving in
    SQLite).
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app),
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

-   *Exercise:* **Code the Ingestion Pipeline:** In their main.py (or a
    separate script/module), each student writes code to open each
    document, split it (e.g., by paragraphs or headings), and use
    Foundry Local's SDK to embed each chunk. Use the Python sqlite3
    library to insert each chunk (text and embedding vector) into the
    database. For simplicity, the embedding can be stored as a blob or
    text (JSON-serialized vector). **Test**: After running ingestion,
    verify the DB has the expected number of entries. Optionally, build
    a simple **setup script** to re-run ingestion if documents are added
    or changed.

-   **Building the Retrieval Function:** With the data in place,
    implement the logic to retrieve relevant chunks when given a new
    user query. Students will:

1.  **Embed the query** (using the same embedding model).

2.  **Search for similar vectors** in SQLite -- here simplest approach
    is to fetch all stored embeddings (or use a SQL extension if
    available) and compute cosine similarity in Python, then pick top-K
    chunks. *(For small N, this is fine; discuss that for large N,
    specialized vector DBs or using SQL extensions would be needed)*.
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app),
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

3.  **Return** the top chunks as context.

-   *Resource:* **Microsoft's tutorial code** for *find_relevant()* (it
    brute-forces similarity for each document, suitable for our scale).
    Also reference the Tech Community blog section on **RAG pipeline**
    decisions (how many chunks to retrieve, etc.).
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app),
    [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-local/tutorials/tutorial-build-rag-app)

-   *Exercise:* **Implement & Test Query Retrieval:** In code, implement
    a function get_top_chunks(query) that returns, say, 2--3 most
    relevant chunks from the SQLite DB given a user query. Test this
    function with a few sample queries against the current data. For
    example, ask questions that you know are covered by one of the
    documents and verify the retrieved text chunks seem relevant. If
    using SQLite, this might involve reading all vectors into memory to
    compare with the query's vector (acceptable for our small dataset).
    If comfortable, an additional challenge: use an **SQL query** with a
    custom distance function or rely on *vector similarity* features if
    using an external vector DB -- but this is optional.

**Milestones by end of Week 3:** Students have a **populated SQLite
document database with embeddings**, and a working **retrieval
function** that can find the top relevant document chunks for a given
query.

### **Week 4:** *LLM Integration & Application Assembly*

**Topics & Activities:**

-   **Integrating the Local LLM (Foundry Local Chat Model):** Now
    connect this retrieval mechanism to a language model to generate
    answers. Students will load a suitable **small LLM** via Foundry
    Local (e.g., *Phi-3.5 Mini or similar 3--5B parameter model*) and
    use it to produce **chat-style** answers. Discuss model selection
    trade-offs: smaller models respond faster, but larger ones provide
    better answers -- in this program we prioritize speed so students
    get quick feedback.

    -   *Resource:* **Foundry Local Quickstart** section on using the
        *native chat completions API* (for multi-turn chat). However, a
        simpler path: treat it like one-turn Q&A. Ensure students see
        how to create a **chat client** from the model and call
        completeChat or similar as shown in documentation.
        [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/),
        [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

    -   *Exercise:* **Model Warm-up:** Students write code to load their
        chosen Foundry Local model at program startup (if not already
        loaded during ingestion). They then write a function
        answer_query(user_question) that uses get_top_chunks() from Week
        3 to retrieve context, and then calls the local model's chat API
        with a **system message** instructing the model to answer using
        the context (and not outside knowledge) followed by the **user's
        question**. **Test the pipeline end-to-end** with a
        straightforward question and inspect the answer.
        [\[azurefeeds.com\]](https://azurefeeds.com/2026/03/30/building-your-first-local-rag-application-with-foundry-local/)

-   **Building a Simple User Interface:** Depending on time and student
    skill, provide options for how the Q&A assistant's interface will
    work:

    -   **Option A: CLI** -- simplest route. Students can prompt for an
        input query via the console, call answer_query(query), and print
        the answer. This keeps focus on backend logic.

    -   **Option B: Streamlit or Gradio UI** (Python) -- great for
        visualization. Provide a minimal Streamlit app that calls
        answer_query when the user submits a question. This gives a
        simple web interface (and is cross-platform).

    -   **Option C: Basic HTML+JS UI** -- (if students want a web dev
        experience). They could reuse the blog's approach: a static HTML
        page with a text box and some JavaScript that calls a local
        Flask or Node server endpoint for answers. Choosing Option A
        ensures completion within timeframe; Options B/C can be offered
        to advanced students or as stretch goals for Week 5 if time
        remains.

    -   *Resource:* **Streamlit documentation** (third-party) or a
        *basic Flask/Express tutorial* (if Option C). Optionally, show
        how the Tech Community blog's sample was a browser-based UI
        served by an Express.js backend.

    -   *Exercise:* **Finalize the App Interface:** Implement the chosen
        UI. For CLI, loop input() to let user ask multiple questions.
        For a web UI, follow the tutorial to set up minimal UI elements
        and integrate with the backend. *Test thoroughly:* ask various
        questions through the interface to verify end-to-end
        functionality -- ensure the retrieval is happening (maybe log
        retrieved chunks for verification) and the model responds
        coherently.

-   **Ensuring Responsible Outputs:** Remind students to apply prompt
    engineering best practices: e.g., always include the instruction
    that if context is insufficient the assistant should say it doesn't
    know **(to avoid fabricating an answer)**. Encourage them to
    fine-tune their system prompt for polite, concise answers. If time
    permits, have them implement *source citations*: e.g., by storing a
    short source name with each chunk and having the model give an
    answer with reference ("according to Document X \..."). This can be
    done by adding instructions in the prompt or simple post-processing
    if needed.

**Milestones by end of Week 4:** Each team has a **working Q&A
application** that can take a user's question (through their chosen
interface) and return an answer generated by the local LLM, using
retrieved content from their *SQLite-backed knowledge base*. The core
project functionality is complete.

## **Phase 3 (Week 5--6): Testing, Evaluation & Documentation**

**Objectives:** In the final phase, students will refine and test their
applications, evaluate performance and accuracy, and produce
documentation and a presentation. By the end of this phase, projects
should be polished and ready to demonstrate.

### **Week 5:** *System Testing & Evaluation*

**Topics & Activities:**

-   **Functional Testing:** Students develop test cases to ensure their
    assistant works for a variety of queries (both queries it can answer
    and ones it should *not* be able to). They should verify that:

    -   The system **returns an answer with relevant info** when the
        answer is in the documents.

    -   It **responds appropriately when information is missing** (e.g.,
        returns a fallback message like "I don't have that information"
        per the system prompt instruction).

    -   It handles edge cases (like empty query input, or very general
        questions). \*Approach:\* Students can compile a small set of
        Q\\&As (some answerable from the docs, some unanswerable) to
        systematically test their bots. If possible, swap test questions
        between teams to simulate "real users." They should run their
        program for each test query and capture the outputs.

-   **Performance & Debugging:** Since everything is local, check that
    response times are reasonable (for small models, e.g., \~1--3
    seconds per question on a typical laptop). If responses are slow,
    discuss potential optimizations (e.g., retrieving fewer chunks,
    using a smaller model, or ensuring not to recompute embeddings
    repeatedly by caching them). Help students debug any outstanding
    issues like incorrect retrieval results or formatting problems in
    answers.

-   **Evaluation and Improvement:** Encourage self-critique and
    iteration. Have students consider questions like: *Are answers
    accurate? Are they well-written and concise? Are sources cited (if
    that was a goal)?* If not, how can they refine their approach (e.g.,
    adjust the prompt format, retrieve more context, or improve chunk
    splitting)? This is an opportunity for them to apply critical
    thinking and improve their project's quality.

**Milestone by mid Week 5:** **Test results** documented -- a list of
queries attempted and whether the responses were correct/appropriate.
Students should identify any shortcomings and plan final adjustments.

### **Week 6 (or end of Week 5):** *Documentation & Final Presentation*

*(Depending on the available time, documentation and presentation prep
can overlap with testing in late Week 5, or extend into Week 6.)*

**Topics & Activities:**

-   **Project Documentation:** Each team writes a short **Project Report
    / README** detailing: the project's purpose, how it works,
    instructions to run the app, and any design decisions or
    limitations. Ensure they include how to set up the environment and
    use the assistant (this also reinforces their understanding). If
    Microsoft Learn modules or tutorials were followed, students should
    reference those.

-   **Code Cleanup & Comments:** Students review their code for clarity.
    They should remove debug prints, add comments explaining key
    sections (e.g., what the retrieval function is doing), and ensure
    their code style is consistent. This is a good point to briefly
    mention version control (if not already used) to highlight best
    practices, though a thorough Git/GitHub intro is likely beyond scope
    unless already known.

-   **Final Presentation Prep:** Each group will give a **short demo and
    presentation** of their local RAG assistant at the end of the
    program. Guide them to highlight:

    -   **Problem Statement:** What scenario or user need does their
        assistant target?

    -   **Key Features/Components:** Briefly explain how it uses RAG,
        what data sources they included, etc.

    -   **Live Demo:** Show the assistant answering a few sample
        questions, including one where it cites a source or says it
        doesn't know (to prove it handles uncertain queries
        responsibly).

    -   **Lessons Learned:** One or two insights or challenges they
        overcame (e.g., "we learned that splitting documents properly
        was crucial for good retrieval results"). Optionally, encourage
        creative elements -- like naming their assistant or customizing
        the interface -- to build presentation confidence and
        engagement.

**Milestones by end of Week 6:** All teams have **completed projects
with documentation** (a final report or README) and have rehearsed their
**presentations/demos**. The program concludes with a **demo day** where
each team presents their working local RAG assistant, reflecting on what
they learned.

Throughout the program, emphasis is on **hands-on learning** reinforced
by curated resources. By following Microsoft's official guidance
(installation instructions, tutorials) combined with practical coding
exercises, students gradually build confidence and competence in each
component before integrating them into the final project. **By the end
of the month, they will have a functional, offline AI Q&A system** --
and a solid understanding of how modern AI applications can be built by
combining **retrieval (search) and generation (LLM)** capabilities and
running them locally.

This plan ensures that the core topics -- Foundry Local, RAG,
embeddings, vector search, data management, and prompt engineering --
are introduced early and then applied in a stepwise fashion, giving
beginners the knowledge and experience to successfully implement and
showcase their first local RAG application.
